# Clean up CSS file and make a UI css class which contains score, lives, incorrect / correct etc.

### Ideas:
- automatically save user score
- maybe in the future we implement genres 
- hardcore mode where you get 1 life and no assitance no colour on the characters 

### To do:
- make the 3 gamemodes
- make settings and stats
- cleanup everything after done / recode everything and modularise
- add a restart button 
- design the restart button better
- needs to make the splash screen disappear when restart button is clicked
### Bugs:
- Uncaught TypeError: formatted_name is undefined
