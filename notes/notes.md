# Clean up CSS file and make a UI css class which contains score, lives, incorrect / correct etc.

### Ideas:
- improve the imput for saving the score
- improve streak p tag
- maybe add a global leaerboard (doubt we can implement this)
- maybe in the future we implement genres 
- hardcore mode where you get 1 life and no assitance no colour on the characters 

### To do:
- make the 3 gamemodes
- make settings and stats
- cleanup everything after done

### Bugs:
- when wrong answer and there is two letters in between a green letter, cant move to next or previous using arrow keys
