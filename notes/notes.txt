Clean up CSS file and make a UI css class which contains score, lives, incorrect / correct etc.
After inputting right guess, disable all input and focus

ideas:
- improve the imput for saving the score
- improve streak p tag
- maybe add a global leaerboard (doubt we can implement this)
-maybe in the future we implement genres 
-hardcore mode where you get 1 life and no assitance no colour on the characters 

todo
- make the 3 gamemodes
- make settings and stats
- add info button in navbar
- improve image selection, some are not transparent, some too low quality
- if you get an answer right and spam enter it will skip some characters
- cleanup everything after done
